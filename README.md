# ReactSQLite

This is a simple React application designed to display data from a local SQLite database file. The app has been built with React, Redux, Express, and SQLite3.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app is currently WIP â€“ the back-end has yet to be finished and other SQLite approaches are being considered. To get the current app up and running, follow these instructions:

1) cd ReactSQLite/base and cd/ReactSQLite/base/client
2) npm install in both directories
3) cd ReactSQLite/base
4) npm run dev

In addition, you'll need to unzip the 'us-census.db.gz' file into the 'base' folder, so the app has a database to read!
