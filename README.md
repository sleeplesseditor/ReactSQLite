# ReactSQLite

This is a simple React application designed to display data from a local SQLite database file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


To get the app up and running, follow these instructions:

1) cd ReactSQLite
2) npm install
3) npm start

In addition, you'll need to unzip the 'us-census.db.gz' file into the 'src/components' folder, so the app has a database to read!
